# address feedback

Review the instructions for creating a tutorial, and the test results from previous steps. Address issues that arose during testing, as long as they are valid and don't contradict your instructions.

## deprecated features

If the previous step identified any deprecated features, revise the scripts and tutorial to use recommended features that provide the same functionality. If there isn't a newer feature available that provides the same functionality, remove the steps that use the deprecated feature. If the tutorial can't be completed without these steps, generate an error report and ask the user what to do next.

## pricing

Note the costs associated with running the resources in the tutorial in the prerequisites section.

## readme
