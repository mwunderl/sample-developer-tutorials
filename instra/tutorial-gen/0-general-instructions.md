you also need an identifier for this tutorial. prefix all filenames with the identifier. If the user didn't provide an identifier, use the name of the current directory.

if the output files for some or all steps already exist in the current directory, use these as input. Limit modifications to existing docs to changes that improve the functionality or guidance.

note the wall time when you start processing a prompt and when you return control to the user. show the actual time elapsed.
