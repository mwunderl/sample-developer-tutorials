## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

1. The AWS CLI. If you need to install it, follow the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
2. Configured your AWS CLI with appropriate credentials. Run `aws configure` if you haven't set up your credentials yet.
3. MongoDB Shell (mongosh) installed on your local machine. To install the MongoDB Shell, follow the [Install mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/) instructions.
4. [Sufficient permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/security-iam.html) to create and manage Amazon DocumentDB resources in your AWS account.
5. A default VPC in your AWS account with at least two subnets in different Availability Zones.

**Estimated time to complete:** 30-45 minutes

**Estimated cost:** If you're eligible for the AWS Free Tier, you can run the resources in this tutorial for up to 750 hours per month for the first 6 months at no cost. Outside the Free Tier, the resources in this tutorial cost approximately $0.08 per hour. Remember to follow the cleanup instructions to avoid ongoing charges.

## Create a DB subnet group

Amazon DocumentDB requires a DB subnet group that includes subnets in at least two different Availability Zones. Let's start by creating a subnet group using subnets from your default VPC.

**Get your default VPC and subnets**

First, identify your default VPC:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=isDefault,Values=true" --query "Vpcs[0].VpcId" --output text
```

This command returns the ID of your default VPC. Next, find subnets in this VPC. Replace `vpc-abcd1234` with your actual VPC ID. 

```bash
aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-abcd1234" --query "Subnets[*].[SubnetId,AvailabilityZone]" --output text
```

The output will show subnet IDs and their Availability Zones. You'll need to select subnets from at least two different Availability Zones.

**Create the DB subnet group**

Now, create a DB subnet group using subnets from different Availability Zones. Replace `subnet-abcd1234` and `subnet-efgh5678` with actual subnet IDs from different Availability Zones. 

```bash
aws docdb create-db-subnet-group \
    --db-subnet-group-name docdb-subnet-group \
    --db-subnet-group-description "Subnet group for DocumentDB tutorial" \
    --subnet-ids subnet-abcd1234 subnet-efgh5678
```

This command creates a subnet group that Amazon DocumentDB will use to deploy your cluster.

You should see output similar to this:

```json
{
    "DBSubnetGroup": {
        "DBSubnetGroupName": "docdb-subnet-group",
        "DBSubnetGroupDescription": "Subnet group for DocumentDB tutorial",
        "VpcId": "vpc-abcd1234",
        "SubnetGroupStatus": "Complete",
        "Subnets": [
            {
                "SubnetIdentifier": "subnet-abcd1234",
                "SubnetAvailabilityZone": {
                    "Name": "us-east-1a"
                },
                "SubnetStatus": "Active"
            },
            {
                "SubnetIdentifier": "subnet-efgh5678",
                "SubnetAvailabilityZone": {
                    "Name": "us-east-1b"
                },
                "SubnetStatus": "Active"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Create a DocumentDB cluster

With the subnet group in place, you can now create your DocumentDB cluster.

**Store credentials securely**

For better security, let's store our database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager instead of using them directly in commands. Replace `YourStrongPassword123!` with a secure password of your choice. 

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
    --name docdb-tutorial-credentials \
    --description "Credentials for DocumentDB tutorial" \
    --secret-string '{"username":"adminuser","password":"YourStrongPassword123!"}'
```

This command stores your credentials securely and returns information about the created secret.

**Create the cluster**

The following command creates a DocumentDB cluster with version 5.0.0. Replace `YourStrongPassword123!` with the same password you stored in Secrets Manager. 

```bash
aws docdb create-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier docdb-cluster \
    --engine docdb \
    --engine-version 5.0.0 \
    --master-username adminuser \
    --master-user-password YourStrongPassword123! \
    --db-subnet-group-name docdb-subnet-group
```

In a production environment, you would retrieve this password directly from Secrets Manager rather than typing it in the command.

**Wait for the cluster to become available**

Creating a cluster takes a few minutes. You can check its status with the following command:

```bash
aws docdb describe-db-clusters \
    --db-cluster-identifier docdb-cluster \
    --query "DBClusters[0].Status" \
    --output text
```

Wait until the status shows `available` before proceeding to the next step. This typically takes 3-5 minutes.

## Create a DocumentDB instance

A DocumentDB cluster requires at least one instance to process requests. Let's create an instance in your cluster.

**Create the instance**

The following command creates a db.t3.medium instance in your cluster:

```bash
aws docdb create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier docdb-instance \
    --db-instance-class db.t3.medium \
    --engine docdb \
    --db-cluster-identifier docdb-cluster
```

The db.t3.medium instance type is eligible for the AWS Free Tier for new customers.

**Wait for the instance to become available**

Creating an instance also takes a few minutes. Check its status with:

```bash
aws docdb describe-db-instances \
    --db-instance-identifier docdb-instance \
    --query "DBInstances[0].DBInstanceStatus" \
    --output text
```

Wait until the status shows `available` before proceeding. This typically takes 5-10 minutes.

## Configure security and connectivity

Before connecting to your cluster, you need to configure security and download the necessary certificate.

**Get cluster endpoint and security group information**

First, retrieve your cluster's endpoint and security group ID:

```bash
aws docdb describe-db-clusters \
    --db-cluster-identifier docdb-cluster \
    --query "DBClusters[0].Endpoint" \
    --output text
```

This returns the endpoint you'll use to connect to your cluster. Save this value for later use.

```bash
aws docdb describe-db-clusters \
    --db-cluster-identifier docdb-cluster \
    --query "DBClusters[0].VpcSecurityGroups[0].VpcSecurityGroupId" \
    --output text
```

This returns the security group ID associated with your cluster. Save this value as well.

**Update security group to allow MongoDB connections**

To connect to your cluster, you need to allow inbound traffic on port 27017 (the default MongoDB port) from your IP address:

```bash
MY_IP=$(curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com)
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id sg-abcd1234 \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 27017 \
    --cidr ${MY_IP}/32
```

Replace `sg-abcd1234` with your security group ID. This command automatically detects your current IP address and allows connections only from that address.

> **Note:** If you have a dynamic IP address that changes frequently, you may need to update this security group rule whenever your IP changes. For production environments, consider using AWS VPN or AWS Direct Connect for more stable connectivity.

**Download the CA certificate**

Amazon DocumentDB requires TLS connections. Download the CA certificate:

First, install wget on macOS (if needed):
```bash
brew install wget
```
Second, use Linux/Windows with wget to download the CA certificate.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/certs
wget https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem -O ~/certs/global-bundle.pem
```

This certificate will be used to establish a secure connection to your cluster. Verify the certificate was downloaded correctly:

```bash
ls -la ~/certs/global-bundle.pem
```

You should see the certificate file in the output.

## Connect to your cluster

Since DocumentDB clusters are only accessible from within the VPC, we'll use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to connect through the EC2 instance. 

**Get your EC2 Instance ID**
Find the Instance ID of the EC2 instance that's created before:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
   --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=DocumentDB-Tutorial-Instance" \
   --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].InstanceId" \
   --output text
```   

Save the instance ID for the following use. 

**Start Session Manager**
Replace `YOUR_INSTANCE_ID` with the actual Instance ID from the previous step.
```bash
aws ssm start-session --target YOUR_INSTANCE_ID
```

**Set up certificate for SSM user**
Once in the session (you'll see `sh-4.2$` prompt), run the following commands: 
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /home/ssm-user/certs
sudo cp /root/certs/global-bundle.pem /home/ssm-user/certs/
sudo chown ssm-user:ssm-user /home/ssm-user/certs/global-bundle.pem
```

**Connect to MongoDB Shell**

Use the following command to connect to your cluster. Replace `/home/ssm-user/certs/global-bundle.pem` with the certificate path that you created in the previous step. Replace the host with your actual cluster endpoint and the password with your actual password. 

```bash
mongosh --tls --tlsCAFile /home/ssm-user/certs/global-bundle.pem \
    --host docdb-cluster.cluster-abcd1234.us-east-1.docdb.amazonaws.com:27017 \
    --username adminuser \
    --password YourStrongPassword123! \
   --retryWrites=false
```

If the connection is successful, you'll see the MongoDB Shell prompt: `test>`.

**Verify connection**
```javascript
db.runCommand({connectionStatus: 1})
```

## Perform database operations

Now that you're connected to your cluster, you can perform various database operations.

**Insert a single document**

Insert a simple document into a collection:

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({"hello":"DocumentDB"})
```

This command inserts a document with a field "hello" and value "DocumentDB" into a collection named "collection". You should see output confirming the insertion with an ObjectId.

**Read the document**

Retrieve the document you just inserted:

```javascript
db.collection.findOne()
```

This returns the document with an automatically generated `_id` field. The output should look similar to:

```
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5e401fe56056fda7321fbd67"), "hello" : "DocumentDB" }
```

**Insert multiple documents**

Insert multiple documents at once:

```javascript
db.profiles.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: 'Matt', status: 'active', level: 12, score: 202 }, 
  { _id: 2, name: 'Frank', status: 'inactive', level: 2, score: 9 }, 
  { _id: 3, name: 'Karen', status: 'active', level: 7, score: 87 }, 
  { _id: 4, name: 'Katie', status: 'active', level: 3, score: 27 }
])
```

This creates a new collection called "profiles" and inserts four documents. You should see output confirming the insertion of all four documents.

**Query all documents in a collection**

Retrieve all documents in the profiles collection:

```javascript
db.profiles.find()
```

This returns all documents in the profiles collection. You should see all four profiles you inserted.

**Query with a filter**

Find a specific document using a filter:

```javascript
db.profiles.find({name: "Katie"})
```

This returns only the document where the name field equals "Katie". You should see just Katie's profile in the output.

**Find and modify a document**

Update a document and return its original content:

```javascript
db.profiles.findAndModify({
  query: { name: "Matt", status: "active"},
  update: { $inc: { score: 10 } }
})
```

This increases Matt's score by 10 points. The output shows the document before the modification.

**Verify the modification**

Check that the update was applied:

```javascript
db.profiles.find({name: "Matt"})
```

The score should now be 212 instead of 202, confirming that the update was successful.

**Exit the MongoDB Shell**

When you're done exploring, exit the MongoDB Shell:

```javascript
exit
```
**Exit the SSM Session**
To disconnect and return to your local terminal, run the following command:
```bash
exit
```

This returns you to your system command prompt.

## Clean up resources

When you're finished with this tutorial, you should delete the resources to avoid incurring additional charges.

**Delete the DB instance**

First, delete the instance:

```bash
aws docdb delete-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier docdb-instance
```

Wait for the instance to be deleted before proceeding:

```bash
aws docdb describe-db-instances \
    --db-instance-identifier docdb-instance \
    --query "DBInstances[0].DBInstanceStatus" \
    --output text
```

Run this command periodically until it returns an error indicating the instance was not found. This typically takes 5-10 minutes.

**Delete the DB cluster**

Next, delete the cluster:

```bash
aws docdb delete-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier docdb-cluster \
    --skip-final-snapshot
```

The `--skip-final-snapshot` parameter tells DocumentDB not to create a final snapshot before deletion. In a production environment, you might want to create a final snapshot for backup purposes.

Wait for the cluster to be deleted:

```bash
aws docdb describe-db-clusters \
    --db-cluster-identifier docdb-cluster \
    --query "DBClusters[0].Status" \
    --output text
```

Run this command periodically until it returns an error indicating the cluster was not found.

**Delete the DB subnet group**

Delete the subnet group:

```bash
aws docdb delete-db-subnet-group \
    --db-subnet-group-name docdb-subnet-group
```

**Delete the secret**

Finally, delete the secret from Secrets Manager:

```bash
aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
    --secret-id docdb-tutorial-credentials \
    --force-delete-without-recovery
```

This completes the cleanup process. All resources created during this tutorial have now been deleted, and you won't incur any further charges.

## Going to production

This tutorial is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates basic Amazon DocumentDB functionality. For production deployments, consider the following additional best practices:

### Security enhancements

1. **IAM authentication** - Use [IAM authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/iam-auth.html) instead of password authentication for stronger security.
2. **VPC endpoints** - Use [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints.html) to keep traffic within the AWS network.
3. **Encryption** - Ensure [encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html) is enabled for all sensitive data.
4. **Audit logging** - Enable [audit logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/event-auditing.html) to track database activities.

### Architecture improvements

1. **High availability** - Deploy multiple instances across different Availability Zones for [high availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/replication.html).
2. **Read scaling** - Add read replicas to distribute read operations and improve performance.
3. **Monitoring** - Set up [CloudWatch monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/cloud-watch.html) for your cluster.
4. **Backup strategy** - Implement a comprehensive [backup and restore strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/backup_restore.html).
