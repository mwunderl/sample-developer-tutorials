This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to AWS Elemental MediaConnect using the AWS CLI. You'll learn how to set up secure, reliable live video transport, configure flows and outputs, and build scalable video streaming workflows for broadcast and streaming applications.

You can either run the provided shell script to automatically set up your MediaConnect flows and basic video transport infrastructure, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial markdown file to understand each component and customize the configuration for your specific video streaming requirements.
